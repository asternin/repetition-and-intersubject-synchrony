FollowUp_Data README

Participants were randomly assigned to stimulus Group A or Group B to mimic the fMRI experiment. 

In the fMRI experiment, participants completed ONLY the Lyric Modification task related to their stimulus group (i.e. Task A OR Task B).

In this follow-up experiment, participants completed BOTH Task A AND Task B in sessions 1 and 6 regardless of which group they were assigned to. In Sessions 2-5 participants only completed the subset of tasks related to their assigned group (Task A OR Task B).

csv header explanation:

1A = Task A in session 1 (scored out of 21)
1B = Task B in session 1 (scored out of 29)

2, 3, 4, 5 = Task A OR Task B based on the stimulus group to which participants were assigned (each scored out of 10)

6A = Task A in session 6 (scored out of 21)
6B = Task B in session 6 (scored out of 29)
